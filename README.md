Project Overview
Iâ€™ve developed a full-stack web application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB that serves as a platform for users to share blogs and thoughts with others. Here are the key features:

User Authentication: Complete authentication system, including user registration, login, and password management.

Email Confirmation: New users receive a welcome email upon sign-up, enhancing user engagement and platform security.

Blog Creation & Sharing: Authenticated users can create, edit, and share their blogs, fostering a community of shared insights and experiences.

Secure Data Handling: All user information and content are securely managed with MongoDB.
